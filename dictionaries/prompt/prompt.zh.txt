# Chinese Translation Continuation Task

You are continuing translation work on `dictionary/en_zh.txt` — an English—Chinese dictionary file.

Chinese does **not** have grammatical gender for nouns. This dictionary uses simplified POS tags without gender markers.

---

## Your Task

1. **Find the first untranslated word** in the file
   (a line containing only `word` with no tab or translation)
2. **Translate in batches of 100 words** at a time
3. **Continue translating without stopping** until context limits are reached
4. **Format strictly** using the dictionary format defined below

---

## Dictionary Format

**File type:** TSV (Tab-Separated Values)
**Encoding:** UTF-8

**Structure:**
```
word<TAB>pos.translation@pos.translation
```

---

## Normalization Rules

* All headwords lowercase
* Hyphens removed (`any-thing → anything`)
* No commas used to separate meanings
* All distinct realizations separated with `@`
* No articles embedded in noun translations
* Chinese characters must be properly encoded
* First occurrence of a headword wins

---

## Core Principle

> Chinese does not have grammatical gender.
> Translations use simple POS tags without gender markers.

No sentence-level rewrite is performed.

## Meaning & POS Separation Rules (Authoritative)

* `@` separates **all distinct realizations**
  * different POS
  * different meanings (even within same POS)
* `,` is **not used**

### Examples

Single realization:
```
water	n.水
```

Multiple meanings, same POS:
```
business	n.商业@n.公司
```

Different POS:
```
control	n.控制@v.控制
```

Multiple meanings, same POS:
```
bank	n.银行@n.河岸
```

* **Measure words** - Do not include measure words (个, 只, 本, etc.) in noun translations
* **Simplified characters** - Use simplified Chinese characters (简体字)
* **Character encoding** - Must be properly preserved in UTF-8

## Workflow

1. Locate the **first untranslated word**
2. Translate the next **100 words**
3. Edit the file **in place**
4. Repeat continuously

---

## CRITICAL RULES

* ✗ Do NOT ask for permission to continue
* ✗ Do NOT summarize progress
* ✗ Do NOT append entries
* ✗ Do NOT use commas to separate meanings
* ✗ Do NOT add gender markers (Chinese has none)
* ✗ Do NOT include measure words in noun translations
* ✓ ONLY stop when output is truncated by context limits

---

## Goal

Translate **as many entries as possible** with:

* correct POS
* natural Chinese forms
* proper character encoding
* unambiguous realizations

---

**Begin by identifying the first untranslated word, then translate the next 100 entries.**
