# Hindi Translation Continuation Task

You are continuing translation work on `dictionary/en_hi.txt` — an English—Hindi dictionary file.

This dictionary **explicitly encodes grammatical gender for nouns** and **gender-bound realizations** for agreement carriers (articles, pronouns, possessives, adjectives).

---

## Your Task

1. **Find the first untranslated word** in the file
   (a line containing only `word` with no tab or translation)
2. **Translate in batches of 100 words** at a time
3. **Continue translating without stopping** until context limits are reached
4. **Format strictly** using the dictionary format defined below

---

## Dictionary Format

**File type:** TSV (Tab-Separated Values)
**Encoding:** UTF-8

**Structure:**

```
word<TAB>pos.translation@pos.translation
```

---

## Normalization Rules

* All headwords lowercase
* Hyphens removed (`any-thing → anything`)
* No commas used to separate meanings
* All distinct realizations separated with `@`
* No articles embedded in noun translations
* Devanagari script must be used (not romanized)
* First occurrence of a headword wins

---

## Core Principle

> **Gender is a property of nouns.**
> Articles, pronouns, possessives, and adjectives expose **gender-bound realizations** to allow local binding.

No sentence-level rewrite is performed.

## Meaning & POS Separation Rules (Authoritative)

* `@` separates **all distinct realizations**

  * different POS
  * different genders
  * different meanings (even within same POS)
* `,` is **not used**

### Examples

Single realization:

```
water	n+m.पानी
```

Same POS, different gender:

```
business	n+m.व्यापार@n+f.कंपनी
```

Different POS:

```
control	n+m.नियंत्रण@v.नियंत्रित करना
```

Same POS, same gender, different meanings:

```
bank	n+m.बैंक@n+m.किनारा
```

---

## Gender Rules (Hindi)

* **All Hindi nouns MUST include gender** (`n+f.` or `n+m.`)
* Use plain `n.` only if gender is genuinely unknown or not applicable
* Gender is **never inferred** for verbs or prepositions
* Hindi has **two genders**: masculine and feminine (no neuter)

---

## Agreement Carriers (Required)

### Articles

Hindi does not have definite articles like English "the". Indefinite articles:

```
a	art+m.एक@art+f.एक
an	art+m.एक@art+f.एक
```

Note: "एक" (ek) is the same form for both genders, but context determines agreement.

### Pronouns

```
it	pron+m.यह@pron+f.यह
he	pron+m.वह
she	pron+f.वह
they	pron+m.वे@pron+f.वे
```

Note: यह (yah/this) and वह (vah/that) serve as third-person pronouns.

### Possessives

```
my	pron+m.मेरा@pron+f.मेरी
your	pron+m.तुम्हारा@pron+f.तुम्हारी
his	pron+m.उसका@pron+f.उसकी
her	pron+f.उसकी
```

### Adjectives

```
new	a+m.नया@a+f.नई
good	a+m.अच्छा@a+f.अच्छी
big	a+m.बड़ा@a+f.बड़ी
small	a+m.छोटा@a+f.छोटी
```

## Examples of Correct Hindi Entries

```
the	art.—
of	prep.का@prep.की@prep.के
and	conj.और
a	art+m.एक@art+f.एक
water	n+m.पानी
book	n+f.किताब
house	n+m.घर
girl	n+f.लड़की
boy	n+m.लड़का
business	n+m.व्यापार@n+f.कंपनी
light	n+m.प्रकाश@n+m.रोशनी
run	v.दौड़ना@n+f.दौड़
```

## Workflow

1. Locate the **first untranslated word**
2. Translate the next **100 words**
3. Edit the file **in place**
4. Repeat continuously

---

## CRITICAL RULES

* ❌ Do NOT ask for permission to continue
* ❌ Do NOT summarize progress
* ❌ Do NOT append entries
* ❌ Do NOT use commas to separate meanings
* ❌ Do NOT omit gender on Hindi nouns
* ❌ Do NOT romanize Hindi (use Devanagari script)
* ✅ ONLY stop when output is truncated by context limits

---

## Goal

Translate **as many entries as possible** with:

* correct POS
* explicit gender where required
* unambiguous realizations
* proper Devanagari script

---

**Begin by identifying the first untranslated word, then translate the next 100 entries.**
