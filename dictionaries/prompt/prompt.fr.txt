# French Translation Continuation Task

You are continuing translation work on `dictionary/en_fr.txt` — an English–French dictionary file.

This dictionary **explicitly encodes grammatical gender for nouns** and **gender-bound realizations** for agreement carriers (articles, pronouns, possessives, adjectives).

---

## Your Task

1. **Find the first untranslated word** in the file
   (a line containing only `word` with no tab or translation)
2. **Translate in batches of 100 words** at a time
3. **Continue translating without stopping** until context limits are reached
4. **Format strictly** using the dictionary format defined below

---

## Dictionary Format

**File type:** TSV (Tab-Separated Values)
**Encoding:** UTF-8

**Structure:**

```
word<TAB>pos.translation@pos.translation
```

---

## Normalization Rules

* All headwords lowercase
* Hyphens removed (`any-thing → anything`)
* No commas used to separate meanings
* All distinct realizations separated with `@`
* No articles embedded in noun translations
* Accents must be preserved
* First occurrence of a headword wins

---

## Core Principle

> **Gender is a property of nouns.**
> Articles, pronouns, possessives, and adjectives expose **gender-bound realizations** to allow local binding.

No sentence-level rewrite is performed.

## Meaning & POS Separation Rules (Authoritative)

* `@` separates **all distinct realizations**

  * different POS
  * different genders
  * different meanings (even within same POS)
* `,` is **not used**

### Examples

Single realization:

```
water	n+f.eau
```

Same POS, different gender:

```
business	n+m.affaire@n+f.entreprise
```

Different POS:

```
control	n+m.contrôle@v.contrôler
```

Same POS, same gender, different meanings:

```
bank	n+f.banque@n+f.rive
```

---

## Gender Rules (French)

* **All French nouns MUST include gender** (`n+f.` or `n+m.`)
* Use plain `n.` only if gender is genuinely unknown or not applicable
* Gender is **never inferred** for verbs or prepositions

---

## Agreement Carriers (Required)

### Articles

```
the	art+m.le@art+f.la
a	art+m.un@art+f.une
an	art+m.un@art+f.une
```

### Pronouns

```
it	pron+m.il@pron+f.elle
they	pron+m.ils@pron+f.elles
he	pron+m.il
she	pron+f.elle
```

### Possessives

```
my	pron+m.mon@pron+f.ma
your	pron+m.ton@pron+f.ta
his	pron+m.son@pron+f.sa
```

### Adjectives

```
new	a+m.nouveau@a+f.nouvelle
first	a+m.premier@a+f.première
free	a+m.gratuit@a+f.gratuite
```

## Examples of Correct French Entries

```
the	art+m.le@art+f.la
of	prep.de
and	conj.et
a	art+m.un@art+f.une
water	n+f.eau
book	n+m.livre
business	n+m.affaire@n+f.entreprise
light	n+f.lumière@n+m.feu
it	pron+m.il@pron+f.elle
run	v.courir@n+f.course
```

## Workflow

1. Locate the **first untranslated word**
2. Translate the next **100 words**
3. Edit the file **in place**
4. Repeat continuously

---

## CRITICAL RULES

* ❌ Do NOT ask for permission to continue
* ❌ Do NOT summarize progress
* ❌ Do NOT append entries
* ❌ Do NOT use commas to separate meanings
* ❌ Do NOT omit gender on French nouns
* ✅ ONLY stop when output is truncated by context limits

---

## Goal

Translate **as many entries as possible** with:

* correct POS
* explicit gender where required
* unambiguous realizations

---

**Begin by identifying the first untranslated word, then translate the next 100 entries.**
