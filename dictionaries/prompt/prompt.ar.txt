# Arabic Translation Continuation Task

You are continuing translation work on `dictionary/en_ar.txt` — an English—Arabic dictionary file.

This dictionary **explicitly encodes grammatical gender for nouns** and **gender-bound realizations** for agreement carriers (articles, pronouns, possessives, adjectives).

---

## Your Task

1. **Find the first untranslated word** in the file
   (a line containing only `word` with no tab or translation)
2. **Translate in batches of 100 words** at a time
3. **Continue translating without stopping** until context limits are reached
4. **Format strictly** using the dictionary format defined below

---

## Dictionary Format

**File type:** TSV (Tab-Separated Values)
**Encoding:** UTF-8

**Structure:**

```
word<TAB>pos.translation@pos.translation
```

---

## Normalization Rules

* All headwords lowercase
* Hyphens removed (`any-thing → anything`)
* No commas used to separate meanings
* All distinct realizations separated with `@`
* No articles embedded in noun translations
* Arabic script must be used (not romanized)
* First occurrence of a headword wins
* Use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), not dialectal forms

---

## Core Principle

> **Gender is a property of nouns.**
> Articles, pronouns, possessives, and adjectives expose **gender-bound realizations** to allow local binding.

No sentence-level rewrite is performed.

## Meaning & POS Separation Rules (Authoritative)

* `@` separates **all distinct realizations**

  * different POS
  * different genders
  * different meanings (even within same POS)
* `,` is **not used**

### Examples

Single realization:

```
water	n+m.ماء
```

Same POS, different gender:

```
business	n+m.عمل@n+f.شركة
```

Different POS:

```
control	n+f.سيطرة@v.يسيطر
```

Same POS, same gender, different meanings:

```
bank	n+m.بنك@n+m.ضفة
```

---

## Gender Rules (Arabic)

* **All Arabic nouns MUST include gender** (`n+f.` or `n+m.`)
* Use plain `n.` only if gender is genuinely unknown or not applicable
* Gender is **never inferred** for verbs or prepositions
* Arabic has **two genders**: masculine and feminine (no neuter)
* Most feminine nouns end in ة (taa marbuta) but not all
* Dual and plural forms may be included as separate meanings if essential

---

## Agreement Carriers (Required)

### Articles

Arabic has a definite article that attaches to nouns:

```
the	art+m.ال@art+f.ال
```

Note: ال (al-) is the same form for both genders, but the noun's inherent gender determines agreement.

### Pronouns

```
he	pron+m.هو
she	pron+f.هي
it	pron+m.هو@pron+f.هي
they	pron+m.هم@pron+f.هن
```

Note: Arabic uses gender-specific plural pronouns.

### Possessives

```
my	pron.ـي
your	pron+m.ـك@pron+f.ـكِ
his	pron+m.ـه
her	pron+f.ـها
```

Note: Possessive pronouns are suffixes in Arabic.

### Adjectives

Arabic adjectives agree in gender with their nouns:

```
new	a+m.جديد@a+f.جديدة
big	a+m.كبير@a+f.كبيرة
small	a+m.صغير@a+f.صغيرة
good	a+m.جيد@a+f.جيدة
```

---

## Examples of Correct Arabic Entries

```
the	art.ال
of	prep.من@prep.لـ
and	conj.و
a	art.—
water	n+m.ماء
book	n+m.كتاب
house	n+m.بيت@n+f.دار
car	n+f.سيارة
school	n+f.مدرسة
business	n+m.عمل@n+f.شركة
light	n+m.ضوء@n+m.نور
run	v.يجري@n+m.جري
```

---

## Special Considerations for Arabic

### Definiteness
The article ال (al-) marks definiteness. Do not include it in noun translations.

```
✓ water	n+m.ماء
✗ water	n+m.الماء
```

### Sun and Moon Letters
The definite article ال assimilates with sun letters (حروف شمسية). This is a phonetic feature handled by the reader software, not encoded in the dictionary.

### Broken Plurals
Arabic has both sound plurals and broken (irregular) plurals. Include only the singular form in noun translations unless the plural has a distinct meaning.

### Verb Forms
Use the he-form (هو) third-person masculine singular present tense as the default verb form:

```
write	v.يكتب
read	v.يقرأ
```

## Workflow

1. Locate the **first untranslated word**
2. Translate the next **100 words**
3. Edit the file **in place**
4. Repeat continuously

---

## CRITICAL RULES

* ❌ Do NOT ask for permission to continue
* ❌ Do NOT summarize progress
* ❌ Do NOT append entries
* ❌ Do NOT use commas to separate meanings
* ❌ Do NOT omit gender on Arabic nouns
* ❌ Do NOT romanize Arabic (use Arabic script)
* ❌ Do NOT include the definite article in noun translations
* ✅ ONLY stop when output is truncated by context limits

---

## Goal

Translate **as many entries as possible** with:

* correct POS
* explicit gender where required
* unambiguous realizations
* proper Arabic script (MSA)

---

**Begin by identifying the first untranslated word, then translate the next 100 entries.**
